# Optimization-Model


This repository contains a solution to a business problem using optimization techniques, as part of a learning exercise or internship task. The project leverages Python and optimization libraries to model and solve the problem.

Project Goal:

The primary goal is to demonstrate the application of optimization techniques, specifically (but not limited to) linear programming, to address a real-world business challenge.

Instructions:

* Solve a business problem using optimization techniques (e.g., Linear Programming).
* Utilize Python libraries like PuLP.**
* Deliverable:A Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the problem formulation, the optimization process, and the obtained solution.

Contents:

This repository will primarily contain the following:

* notebooks/: This directory will contain the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file) that demonstrates the solution. The notebook will likely include:
    * Problem Definition: A clear description of the business problem being addressed.
    * Mathematical Formulation:The formulation of the problem as an optimization model (e.g., defining decision variables, objective function, and constraints).
    * Implementation using PuLP: The Python code using the PuLP library to define and solve the optimization problem.
    * Results and Interpretation: Presentation of the optimal solution and its interpretation in the context of the business problem.
* README.md:This file (the one you are currently reading) providing a brief overview of the project and instructions for viewing the solution.

* requirements.txt: A file listing the Python dependencies, specifically PuLP, required to run the notebook.

Getting Started:

To view and run the solution, follow these steps:

  Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository_url]
   cd [repository_name]
   ```

2. Set up the environment:
    It is highly recommended to create a virtual environment.
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
     venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
     ```
   * Install the necessary dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory:
   ```bash
   cd notebooks
   ```

4. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook(e.g., using JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook):
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook  # or jupyter lab
   ```
   Locate and open the `.ipynb` file. Follow the instructions and execute the cells within the notebook to understand the problem, the optimization model, and the solution.

Deliverable:

The main deliverable for this task is the Jupyter Notebook located in the `notebooks/` directory. This notebook demonstrates the entire process of solving the business problem using optimization techniques and the PuLP library.
